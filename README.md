GWT-d3js
========

D3.js script embeded in a GWT Module. This module serves as the basis for the [gwt-d3](https://github.com/gwtd3/gwt-d3) library.

Goals
-----

This project aims to help GWT developpers to embed the JavaScript library [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) in their GWT projects, as a GWT Module.

The release process follows the official library versioning. This way, developpers can easily upgrade or downgrade the dependency version by referring to the official release notes.

Non-Goals
---------

GWT-d3js is not a Java wrapper for d3.js. If you are looking for a wrapper, you should take a look at [gwt-d3](https://github.com/gwtd3/gwt-d3).

GWT-d3js does not enhance D3 in any way. The source code embeded in the JAR file comes directly from the official [D3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), unmodified.
